# Elden Ring Seamless Co-op Manager
Manager for Elden Ring's [Seamless Co-op mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/510)

**Note:** Windows only

## Features
* Config editor to easily change the mod's settings
* Save settings as presets and quickly swap between them
* Update Seamless Coop while maintaining previous settings
* Launch Seamless Coop

## Usage
Just download the exe from the [latest release](https://github.com/jkromberg4/ersc-manager/releases/latest) and run it.

Some notes:
* It will create an "ERSC Manager" folder in the directory it is run in to store any configs you might create
* It attempts to automatically find Elden Ring's installation location, but if it can't it will ask for it
* It is unnecessary, but fine, to have a prior Seamless Co-op installation
